# Snake Game
A simple Snake Game built in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

The snake will move continuously in the current direction.

The goal is to eat the food (the blue dot) to grow the snake and earn points.

The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
